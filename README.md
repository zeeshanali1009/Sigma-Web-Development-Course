-----------------First of all there is HTML SERIES--------------------------
There are two types of tags in the HTML which are as follow:
1. Paired Tags (contains opening and closing tags)
2. Self Closing Tags
----------------- SEO and Core Web Vitals --------------------------
These web vitals are there for the better rankings and better performance of the website.
There are three things to judge the performance of any website (Core Web Vitals):
1. CLS (Commulative Layout Shift ) --- How much there is the shifting of the pages --- must be less  ----
2. LSP (Largest Contentful Paint) ---- how much time big element on the website takes to load -- should be less
3. FID (First Input Delay)  In how much time the input being given to the website is recorded or loaded.
These things can be analyzed in the lighthouse section on the inspect element and can be remake after complete analysis. Usually adjusting width and height is the best practice.
